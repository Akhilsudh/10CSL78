## Web Programming Laboratory (VTU 10CSL78)

### List of Experiments: 
#### 1.  Develop  and  demonstrate  a  XHTML  file  that  includes Javascript  script for the following problems
* [Input:    A number n obtained using prompt 
Output: The first n Fibonacci numbers ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/1a.html)    
* [Input:     A number n obtained using prompt 
Output:  A table of numbers from 1 to n and their squares using alert ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/1b.html)    

#### 2.  
* [Develop and demonstrate, using Javascript script, a XHTML document that  collects  the  USN  (  the  valid  format  is:  A  digit  from  1  to  4  followed by  two  upper-case  characters  followed  by  two  digitsfollowed  by  two upper-case  characters  followed  by  three  digits;  no embedded  spaces allowed)  of  the  user.  Event  handler  must  be  included  for  the  form element  that  collects  this  information  to  validate the  input.  Messages  in the alert windows must be produced when errors are dete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/2a.html)   
* [Modify  the  above  program  to  get  the  current  semester  also  (restricted to be a number from 1 to 8)  ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/2b.html)   

#### 3. 
* [Develop and demonstrate, using Javascript script, a XHTML document that contains three short paragraphs of text, stacked on top of each other, with only enough of each showing so that the mouse cursor can be placed over some part of  them. When the cursor is placed over the exposed part of any paragraph, it should rise to the top to become completely visible. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/3a.html)
* [ Modify  the  above  document  so  that  when  a  paragraph  is  moved  from the  top  stacking  position,  it  returns  to  its  original  position  rather  than  to the bottom.   ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/3b.html)   

#### 4. 
* [Design  an  XML  document  to  store  information  about  a  student  in  an engineering  college  affiliated  to  VTU.  The  information  must  include USN, Name, Name of the College, Brach, Year of Joining, and e-mail id. Make  up  sample  data  for  3  students.  Create  a  CSS  style  sheet  and  use  it to display the document. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/4a.xml)
* [ Create  an  XSLT  style  sheet  for  one  student  element  of  the  above document and use it to create a display of that element](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/4b.xml)

#### 5. 
* [Write a Perl program to display various Server Information like Server Name, Server Software, Server protocol, CGI Revision etc. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/5a.pl)
* [Write  a  Perl  program  to  accept  UNIX  command  froma  HTML  form and to display the output of the command executed. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/5b.pl)

#### 6. 
* [Write  a  Perl  program  to  accept  the  User  Name  anddisplay  a  greeting message randomly chosen from a list of 4 greeting messages. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/6a.pl)
* [Write  a  Perl  program  to  keep  track  of  the  numberof  visitors  visiting the web page and to display this count of visitors,with proper headings. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/6b.pl)

#### 7. 
[Write a Perl program to display a digital clock which displays the current time of the server. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/7.pl)

#### 8. 
[Write  a  Perl  program  to  insert  name  and  age  informa
tion  entered  by  the 
user into a table created using MySQL and to displa
y the current contents 
of this table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akhilsudh/10CSL78/master/8.html)
